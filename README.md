<h1>
2D Vector Unit Test
</h1>

<h3>
Export your vec2 struct or class into a new file called "vec2.h". <br>
Put it in the same folder as vec2_test.cpp. <br>
Compile and run vec2_test.cpp to see if your vec2 is solid. <br>
When all your tests are good, save your vec2.h file. 
We will be using it and adding to it later.
</h3>
